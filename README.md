# How to run this script

If you know, how the terminal works, just skip this whole part. If not, here is a small introduction:
* Open the file xls2csv.sh with a right click, choose "Open with" and then "Other..."
* Here you select the application you want the file to execute into, in this case it would be Terminal. To be able to select terminal you need to switch from "Recommended Applications" to "All Applications". (The Terminal.app application can be found in the Utilities folder)
* **NOTE** that unless you don't want to associate all files with this extension to be run in terminal you should not have "Always Open With" checked.
* After clicking OK you should be able to execute you script by simply double-clicking it.


**EDIT:**
If you can't select "Terminal", either get yourself a cool terminal (ohmyzsh and iTerm2) or just drag&drop the file xls2csv.sh to your opened terminal. Then it should work properly ;)
